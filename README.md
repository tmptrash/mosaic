# mosaic
Photo mosaic algorithm implementation in pure JS

# how to run
Prepare a folder with images (in our example it's called `imgs`). Find as many images as you can, because it affects final picture quality. Install dependencies and run local http-server with `imgs` folder as a parameter. Don't forget to add `--cors` parameter in the end.\
\
`npm i` - to install dependencies\
`npx http-server ./imgs --cors` to run local server with images\
`npm run start` - to run mosaic in a dev mode\
`npm run build` - to build mosaic in production
